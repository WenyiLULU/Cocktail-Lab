# Cocktail-Lab

## Description
Cocktail Lab is a great way to view, create and store cocktail recipes! It allows you to see cocktail details such as name, ingredients, amounts, image and steps to make it. We also have a choice of alcoholic and non-alcoholic coctails, so you can make them without alcohol if preferred. You can create your own and upload it to the site, and edit or delete them as needed. 
 
For best performance use a computer with a Chrome or Firefox browser to view the site. It is not yet supported for mobile phone use. 

The idea behind the project was to create an Express app and use Mongoose for models and database communication. We used HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as validation (sessions & cookies). This includes sign up, log in & log out functionality with encrypted passwords. Further technical improvements could be made to the website in the future.

The website was first launched in June 2022 via Heroku.
